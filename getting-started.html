There are different approaches on how to setup Chronos. The easiest and recommend way is to use the <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control/blob/master/install.php">install</a> script. 

The <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control">Getting Started</a> of our GitHub readme outlines the necessary steps to install Chronos Control using the install script. Please make sure to check the requirements section and to install missing software if required.
