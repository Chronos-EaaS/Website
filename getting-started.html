<p>This page gives an overview on how to deploy and use Chronos. To learn more about Chronos itself, check the <a href="/about/">about page</a>.</p>

<h1>Setup Chronos Control</h1>
<p>There are different approaches on how to setup Chronos. The easiest and recommend way is to use the <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control/blob/master/install.php">install</a> script. The <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control">GitHub readme</a> outlines the necessary steps to install Chronos Control using the provided install script. Please make sure to check the requirements section and to install missing software if required.</p>


<br>
<h1>Integrate Chronos Agent</h1>
<p>If you already have an evaluation client for your system you now need to connect it with Chronos Control. In the Chronos terminology, the module which handles this communication is called <i>Chronos Agent</i>. We provide a <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Agent">reference implementation</a> of Chronos Agent in Java. We recommend to use this this implementation for your project because it supports all features.</p>

<p>If you are using a non-jvm language it is possible to write your own Chronos Agent. The whole communication between Chronos Agent and Chronos Control is REST-based which makes it easy to implement. Please get in touch with us if you implemented our own Chronos Agent library consider sharing it.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/MongoDB-Demo-Client">MongoDB Demo Client</a> we provide a demo implementation of an evaluation client supporting Chronos. This implementation wraps the Yahoo YCSB benchmark. Check <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/MongoDB-Demo-Client/blob/master/src/main/java/ch/unibas/dmi/dbis/chronos/demoagent/ChronosAgent.java">ChronosAgent.java</a> to see how simple it is to to enable a existing benchmark to be used with Chronos.</p>


<br>
<h1>Contribute</h1>
<p>Please consider making Chronos even better by contributing to its development. This does not necessarily mean writing code, also contributions to this website or a documentation are equally appreciated. Please get in touch with us in case your interested.</p>


<br>
<h1>Spread the world</h1>
<p>Open source software is from anyone for anyone. Here a few suggestions what you can do:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a researcher, consider citing our demo paper in your next publication.</li>
<li>Tell your colleges about Chronos and support them with their first steps towards easy and reproducible evaluations.</li>
<li>Star the GitHub repository</li>
</ul>
</p>


<br>
