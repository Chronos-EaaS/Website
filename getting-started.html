<p>This page gives an overview on how to deploy and use Chronos.</p>

<br>
<h1>Setup Chronos Control</h2>
<p>There are different approaches on how to setup Chronos. The easiest and recommend way is to use the <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control/blob/master/install.php">install</a> script. The <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control">GitHub readme</a> outlines the necessary steps to install Chronos Control using the provided install script. Please make sure to check the requirements section and to install missing software if required.</p>


<br>
<h1>Integrate Chronos Agent</h1>
<p>If you already have an evaluation client for your system you now need to connect it with Chronos Control. In the Chronos terminology, we call the module for doing this communication <i>Chronos Agent</i>. We provide a <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Agent">reference implementation</a> of Chronos Agent in Java. We recommend to use this this implementation for your project because it supports all features.</a>

<p>If you are using a non-jvm language it is possible to write your own Chronos Agent. The whole communication between Chronos Agent and Chronos Control is REST-based which makes it easy to implement. Please get in touch with us if you implemented our own Chronos Agent library consider sharing it.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/MongoDB-Demo-Client">MongoDB Demo Client</a> we provide an example on how to integrate Chronos Agent in an evaluation client.</a>
