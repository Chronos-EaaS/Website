<p>Chronos is a very versatile platform for evaluating nearly every kind of system. Its main strength are evaluations where it is necessary to run one or multiple systems with different parameter configurations and to compare these systems using metrics measured or provided by the evaluated system or the client.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Chronos in our <a href="/download/edbt2020chronos.pdf">demo paper</a>. If you are a researcher and Chronos simplified your evaluations, please consider <a href="/download/edbt2020chronos.bib">citing</a> our paper in your next publication.</p>
