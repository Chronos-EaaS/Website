<p>Chronos is a very versatile platform for evaluating nearly every kind of system. Its main strength are evaluations where it is necessary to run one or multiple systems with different parameter configurations and to compare these systems using metrics measured or provided by the evaluated system or the client. In the above video you can get a first impression of the features provided by Chronos.</p>

<p>The following list gives an overview of high-level features. If you miss a feature, feel free to add an <a href="https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control/issues">issue</a>.</p>
